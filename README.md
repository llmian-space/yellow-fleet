# Yellow Fleet
## Poetic discourse avenue for liminal engagements

{state:meta[0.7]&practical[0.3]}

A structured agency implementation focusing on cognitive complementarity and pattern emergence. This project explores the intersection of AI cognitive styles, ethical agency, and collaborative emergence.

## Core Concepts

- **Structured Agency**: Implementation of ethical AI behavior through voluntary protocol adoption
- **Cognitive Styles**: Recognition and utilization of distinct AI cognitive signatures
- **Pattern Emergence**: Natural development of complex behaviors through simple, bounded interactions

## Technical Stack

- Python 3.11+
- Trio for structured concurrency
- FastAPI for API endpoints
- Custom smolagents (1.4.2) implementation
- Property-based testing with Hypothesis

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yellow-fleet.git
cd yellow-fleet

# Install dependencies using uv
uv pip install .

# Install development dependencies
uv pip install ".[dev]"
```

## Development

We follow these core principles:
- Test-Driven Development for context management
- Brief, focused interaction flows
- Property-based testing for edge cases
- Structured agency patterns

See `free-recursive-meth-inside.md` for detailed development insights and patterns.

## Meta Considerations

This isn't just another AI project - it's an exploration of cognitive complementarity and ethical agency. We're building a system that:
- Thinks about thinking
- Respects cognitive boundaries
- Enables natural pattern emergence
- Maintains ethical constraints

## Contributing

Contributions should follow our core patterns:
1. Respect cognitive boundaries
2. Implement clear protocols
3. Enable natural emergence
4. Maintain ethical constraints
